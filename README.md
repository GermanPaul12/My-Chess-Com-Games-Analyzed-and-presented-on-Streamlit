# Automated Chess Game Analyzer

Welcome to the Chess Game Analyzer project! This repository contains over 3800 chess games collected from chess.com and analyzed using various techniques. The results of the analysis are presented in a Streamlit web application for easy exploration and visualization.

## Overview

Chess is a game of strategy and tactics, and analyzing games played by skilled players can provide valuable insights into different opening strategies, tactical patterns, and endgame techniques. In this project, I have collected a large dataset of chess games from chess.com and performed detailed analysis on them.
